# SeedlingEducation
This is an attempt at creating a web server project
for the benefit of Modesto Junior College
and the communities affected by it. It serves as a
hub of information for those motivated enough
to seek out opportunities beyond the immediate.
It serves as a resource of education that enriches
the classes and allows for those struggling to
have tailored help. Through this project, the seedlings
at this school hope to grow into towering trees.

The central idea differs from CommunityALI or the
MJC site because this site is more verbose
and focuses on a connection between the students
and the school. As such, a "bloggy" type of model
has been adapted into the formulation of the site.
It will also be actively maintained by students
and have minimal bloat and minimal bureaucratic approach.

## Github Contributions
At this moment, there are two branches: main and frontend.
Clone the repository.
Set the main to your upstream as such:
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main <variable_name>.
the <variable_name> can be found with the git branch
command.

### Setting Upstream:

Setting an upstream branch establishes a link between your 
current branch and a specified remote branch.
This is useful when you want to track changes from a 
specific remote branch in your current branch
The upstream setting merely establishes a default remote branch 
that your local branch will interact with when you run commands 
like git pull or git merge.

### Pulling:

git pull: is a command that fetches the latest changes from the remote 
repository and merges them into your current branch.
It essentially combines git fetch and git merge into a single
command.

### Fetching:

git fetch: is a command that retrieves the latest changes from the remote repository without merging them into your current branch.
This allows you to review the changes before deciding whether to merge them.
